# odin-recipes
Basic HTML website featuring a few different food recipes
Includes a landing page (index.html) which links to pages containing the recipes themselves with pictures of the completed dishes, unordered lists of ingredients and ordered lists of the steps needed to cook them. 
Skills used:
Html commands like linking pages, images, as well as html formatting like ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, headings, and line breaks.
Git commits used throughout to save as I went.
